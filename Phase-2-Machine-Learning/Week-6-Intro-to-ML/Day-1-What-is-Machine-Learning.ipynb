    "\n",
    "**Example:** Organizing a messy closet\n",
    "- No labels, but you group similar items together\n",
    "- Shirts in one pile, pants in another\n",

    "**AI Examples:**\n",

    "- Anomaly detection (finding unusual patterns)\n",
    "- Topic modeling (grouping similar documents)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**What it is:** Learning by trial and error with rewards\n",

    "**Example:** Training a dog\n",
    "- Do trick correctly → Get treat 🦴 (reward)\n",
