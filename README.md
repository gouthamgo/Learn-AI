## 🎓 How to Use This Course

### 1️⃣ Follow the Path
Start with Week 1, Day 1 and work sequentially. Each lesson builds on the previous one!

### 2️⃣ Hands-On Learning
**IMPORTANT**: Don't just read the code - RUN IT!
- Click the ▶️ button on each code cell in Google Colab
- Modify the code and see what happens
- Break things and fix them (best way to learn!)

### 3️⃣ Do ALL Exercises
Every lesson has practice exercises. These are critical for mastery!

### 4️⃣ Build Projects
At the end of each week/section, build the mini-projects. These go in your portfolio!

## 💡 How Google Colab Works (FREE!)

```html
<!-- Change this: -->
https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR-USERNAME/Learn-AI/...

<!-- To this: -->
https://colab.research.google.com/github/youractualusername/Learn-AI/...
```

Commit and push - Vercel will auto-update!

## 📊 Track Your Progress

Create a file called `my-progress.md` to track what you've learned:

```markdown
# My AI Learning Journey

## Week 1: Python Basics
- [x] Day 1: Variables ✅ (Date: 2024-01-15)
- [x] Day 2: Lists & Loops ✅ (Date: 2024-01-16)
- [ ] Day 3: Functions (In Progress)

### What I Learned:
- Variables are like labeled boxes
- Lists store multiple items
- Loops automate repetitive tasks

### Challenges:
- Struggled with list indexing at first
- Practiced with extra exercises - now it makes sense!

### Projects Built:
- [x] Model Performance Reporter
```
