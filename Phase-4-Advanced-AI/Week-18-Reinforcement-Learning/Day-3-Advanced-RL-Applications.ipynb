    "## 🤝 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Agent RL = Multiple agents learning simultaneously in shared environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multi-Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single-agent problems:**\n",
    "- Agent vs static environment\n",
    "- Example: Single robot navigating maze\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-agent problems:**\n",
    "- Multiple agents interacting\n",
    "- Environment changes due to other agents!\n",
    "- Example: Self-driving cars in traffic, multi-player games\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Types of Multi-Agent Settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Cooperative (All agents work together):**\n",
    "- **Goal:** Maximize team reward\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - Warehouse robots coordinating\n",
    "  - Soccer playing robots\n",
    "  - Drone swarms\n",
    "  - Traffic light coordination\n",
    "- **Challenge:** Credit assignment (which agent contributed?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Competitive (Agents oppose each other):**\n",
    "- **Goal:** Beat opponent\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - Chess, Go, Poker\n",
    "  - 1v1 games\n",
    "  - Adversarial scenarios\n",
    "- **Challenge:** Non-stationary environment (opponent adapts!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mixed (Cooperation + Competition):**\n",
    "- **Goal:** Team vs team\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - Dota 2 (5v5), StarCraft\n",
    "  - Autonomous vehicle coordination\n",
    "  - Economic markets\n",
    "- **Challenge:** Both credit assignment AND non-stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Non-Stationarity:**\n",
    "- Other agents learning → environment changes\n",
    "- Breaks Markov assumption!\n",
    "- Solution: Model other agents, centralized training\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Credit Assignment:**\n",
    "- Which agent caused team success/failure?\n",
    "- Global reward but local actions\n",
    "- Solution: Individual reward shaping, counterfactual reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scalability:**\n",
    "- Joint action space grows exponentially\n",
    "- Communication overhead\n",
    "- Solution: Decentralized execution, communication protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Famous Multi-Agent RL Systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. OpenAI Five (2019):**\n",
    "- 5 agents play Dota 2 (5v5 team game)\n",
    "- Beat world champion team OG\n",
    "- 10,000 years of gameplay per day!\n",
    "- Used PPO with team spirit reward\n",

    "- DeepMind's StarCraft II agent\n",
    "- League training (agents play each other)\n",
    "- Reached Grandmaster level\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Google Data Centers (2016-present):**\n",
    "- Multiple cooling units coordinate\n",
    "- 40% energy reduction\n",
    "- Saved millions of dollars\n",
    "\n",

    "### The AlphaGo Revolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**March 2016:** AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol 4-1\n",
    "- Lee Sedol: 18-time world champion, top 3 player\n",
    "- Go: More complex than Chess (10^170 possible games!)\n",
    "- \"Impossible\" task 10 years earlier\n",
    "- Shocked AI community and general public\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Go Was Hard:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "- **Chess:** ~10^120 possible games\n",
    "- **Go:** ~10^170 possible games (more than atoms in universe!)\n",
    "- **Board size:** Go = 19×19 = 361 positions\n",
    "- **Average game length:** ~150 moves (vs ~40 in chess)\n",
    "- **Branching factor:** ~250 legal moves per position (vs ~35 in chess)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional approaches failed:**\n",
    "- Minimax: Too many positions to search\n",
    "- Evaluation: Hard to evaluate board position (who's winning?)\n",
    "- Human knowledge: Patterns too complex to encode\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 AlphaGo Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Policy Network (π):**\n",
    "- **Input:** Board position\n",
    "- **Output:** Probability for each move\n",
    "- **Training:** \n",
    "  - Supervised learning on human games (imitate experts)\n",
    "  - Reinforcement learning through self-play\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Suggest good moves (narrows search)\n",

    "**2. Value Network (V):**\n",
    "- **Input:** Board position\n",
    "- **Output:** Win probability (who's winning?)\n",
    "- **Training:** Self-play games\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Evaluate positions without playing to end\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Look ahead and plan\n",
    "- **Process:**\n",
    "  1. **Selection:** Navigate tree using UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)\n",
    "  2. **Expansion:** Add new node\n",
    "  3. **Simulation:** Play out using policy network\n",
    "  4. **Backup:** Update values\n",
    "- **Combines:** Neural networks (intuition) + search (planning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Training Pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Phase 1: Supervised Learning\n",
