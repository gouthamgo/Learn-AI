    "\n",
    "**Before using ANY dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Size**: Enough examples? (Minimum: 1000+ for most tasks)  \n",
    "✅ **Balance**: Are classes balanced?  \n",
    "✅ **Quality**: Missing values? Errors? Outliers?  \n",
    "✅ **Relevance**: Matches your problem?  \n",
    "✅ **License**: Can you use it? Commercial OK?  \n",
    "✅ **Bias**: Any demographic/sample bias?  \n",
    "✅ **Freshness**: Is data recent enough?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Data Collection Strategy by Project Type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Classification:**\n",
    "1. Search Kaggle/ImageNet\n",
    "2. If not found, use Google Images API\n",
    "3. Supplement with custom photos\n",
    "4. Augment to increase size\n",
    "\n",
    "**NLP/Text:**\n",
    "1. Check HuggingFace Datasets\n",
    "2. Use Twitter/Reddit API\n",
    "3. Web scrape news/blogs\n",
    "4. Generate synthetic data (GPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series:**\n",
    "1. Financial data (Yahoo Finance)\n",
    "2. Government data (data.gov)\n",
    "3. IoT sensors\n",
    "4. Web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tabular:**\n",
    "1. Kaggle competitions\n",
    "2. UCI repository\n",
    "3. Industry-specific sources\n",
    "4. Synthetic data generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Pro Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start small**: Get 100 examples working before collecting 100,000\n",
    "2. **Version control**: Track data versions (DVC, Git LFS)\n",
    "3. **Document sources**: Note where every piece came from\n",
    "4. **Test/Train split FIRST**: Prevent data leakage\n",
    "5. **Augmentation**: Use data augmentation to expand dataset"

    "### 🎨 GitHub Profile Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create a Profile README**\n",
    "- Create repo: `username/username`\n",
    "- Add README.md (shows on your profile!)\n",
    "- Include: Bio, skills, featured projects\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Pin Your Best Projects**\n",
    "- Pin 6 repositories\n",
    "- Choose diverse projects\n",
    "- Prioritize recent, complete work\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Commit Consistently**\n",
    "- Green squares matter!\n",
    "- Commit regularly (even small updates)\n",
    "- Shows dedication and activity\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Use Topics/Tags**\n",
    "- Add relevant tags: `machine-learning`, `pytorch`, `nlp`\n",
    "- Makes projects discoverable\n",
    "- Shows up in search\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Add Badges**\n",

    "### ⚠️ Common GitHub Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Don't:**\n",
    "- Upload 100s of tutorial repos (looks like tutorial hell)\n",
    "- Commit passwords/API keys (.gitignore them!)\n",
    "- Have empty or poorly documented projects\n",
    "- Use vague names (\"project1\", \"ai-stuff\")\n",
    "- Upload massive files (>100MB) without Git LFS\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Do:**\n",
    "- 5-10 QUALITY projects > 100 tutorials\n",
    "- Clear, descriptive names\n",
    "- Professional README for each\n",
    "- Regular commits showing progress\n",
    "- Include demo GIFs/images\n",
